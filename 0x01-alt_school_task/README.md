- [Images](./img): This directory contains all images used for this project.

- [Styles](./styles/): This directory contains all my css files for this project.

## Files üìÉ

* All of the following files are pages created with `HTML` and styled using `CSS`

_Filename_ | _Description_
-----------|--------------
[about Me](./about.html) | Home page
[Calculator](./calc.html) | Static calculator UI page
[Contact](./contact.html) | contact Page
[Login](./login.html) | Login page
[Register](./register.html) | Registration page

## Objective üõÖ

* **Build a simple `HTML` & `CSS` driven web application made up of a few linked pages and styled content**

  1. **Create a `HTML` page with the following information: *Home page which you will call [About Me](about.html), [contact page](contact.html), [register page](register.html) and [login pag](login.html)***

  2. **The following should be included in your About Me page (which is your home page but will have the name About Me instead):**
    - *Your name*
    - *A sentence about yourself*
    - *Your goal for this Diploma course*
    - *Education (list your past education and certificates)*
    - *Job experience*
    - *Hobbies & other skills*

  3. **Create a Contact section within the page in step (1), using a form with the below fields. The form should have a submit button and basic `HTML` validation**
    - *Name*
    - *Email*
    - *Message*
    - *Priority (dropdown)*

  4. **Add a register page. It should have the below fields with `HTML` validation as well**
    - *First Name*
    - *Last Name*
    - *Phone*
    - *Gender (dropdown)*
    - *Country*
    - *State/province*
    - *Username*
    - *Password*
    - *Confirm password*

  5. **Add a *Login page* with a username field and a password field. Add basic `HTML` validation to the login form. It should have a submit button with the label of ‚ÄúSign In‚Äù**

  6. **Add a navigation menu at the top of the home page(*About Me page*). It should contain links to the sections within the page. Also, since you have 4 pages (*the home page with your details, the contact page, the register page and the login page)*, add items to the menu that links the pages together so that there‚Äôs no dead end and you can always go from the home page to the others pages and then back to the home page**

  7. **Create a *Calculator* page and create a calculator `UI` in it, using the `HTML` Table element. You will be back to make the calculator functional, but the goal for now is to make it look great, so apply what you have learnt about `HTML` & `CSS`. The Calculator should have:**
    - A text field at the top
    - Numbers `0` to `9`
    - Regular Maths operators like addition `(+)`, subtraction `(-)`, multiplication `(*)`, division `(/)`, and modulo `(%)`

  8. **Somewhere on the page where it makes sense visually, add a photo of yourself**

  9. **Bonus: Re-create the calculator `UI` in a new page, using `CSS` flexbox instead of using a table like earlier requested**
